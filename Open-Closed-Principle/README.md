# Open Closed Principle

> **SOFTWARE ENTITIES (CLASSES, MODULES, FUNCTIONS, ETC.) SHOULD BE OPEN FOR EXTENSION, BUT CLOSED FOR MODIFICATION.**

In object-oriented programming, the openâ€“closed principle states "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.
